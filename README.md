## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (for building from source)

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sailock.git
cd sailock/Sailock
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### First run

On first launch, Sailock will prompt you to create a master password. This password is used to derive the encryption key for your `.slock` data file. **There is no recovery mechanism — do not forget your master password.**

---

## Data & Security

- All data is stored in a single encrypted file (`sailock.slock`) on your local machine.
- The encryption key is derived from your master password using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a random salt.
- Each save generates a new salt and IV, so no two encrypted files are identical even with the same data.
- Sailock never sends any data over the network.
